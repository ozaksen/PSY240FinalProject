However, once you reach the top, you will have a breathtaking view of the island from above. You may feel proud of yourself and think it was the best choice",

The path is easier, but you will have to face a strong wind and hot sun that might make you tired. However, you may find some treasures washed up by the waves on the beach. You may feel happy to have found some treasure and think it was the best choice."
